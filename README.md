# Bizrate Insights GTM community gallery template: Buyer Survey Solution
This repository holds the BRI Google Tag Manager custom template for rendering Point of Sale invitations for merchants.

# Instructions
To import a template file into your Google Tag Manager container, follow these steps:

1. Download the `.tpl` file you want to import.
2. Create a new **template** in Google Tag Manager (either *tag* or *variable*, depending on which type you are importing).
3. In the action menu in the top right corner of the template editor, choose **Import**.
4. Select the `.tpl` file from your container.

Importing a template file like this always **overwrites** any work you might have done in the underlying template, so you should always import to a newly created template.

To make use of the template, you must construct variables and triggers around the tag itself.
